# Face Recognition based Attendance System
## Introduction
The system is developed for deploying an easy and secure way of marking attendance.
The system first captures images of all the authorized persons and stores the information into database.
The system then stores each image by mapping it into a face coordinate structure.
Next time when the registered person enters the premises, the system recognizes the person and marks his attendance.

We have used PubFig: Public Figures Face Database for training and testing of our model.
